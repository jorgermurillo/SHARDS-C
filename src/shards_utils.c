/*
           An implementation of top-down splaying with sizes
             D. Sleator <sleator@cs.cmu.edu>, January 1994.

  This extends top-down-splay.c to maintain a size field in each node.
  This is the number of nodes in the subtree rooted there.  This makes
  it possible to efficiently compute the rank of a key.  (The rank is
  the number of nodes to the left of the given key.)  It it also
  possible to quickly find the node of a given rank.  Both of these
  operations are illustrated in the code below.  The remainder of this
  introduction is taken from top-down-splay.c.

  "Splay trees", or "self-adjusting search trees" are a simple and
  efficient data structure for storing an ordered set.  The data
  structure consists of a binary tree, with no additional fields.  It
  allows searching, insertion, deletion, deletemin, deletemax,
  splitting, joining, and many other operations, all with amortized
  logarithmic performance.  Since the trees adapt to the sequence of
  requests, their performance on real access patterns is typically even
  better.  Splay trees are described in a number of texts and papers
  [1,2,3,4].

  The code here is adapted from simple top-down splay, at the bottom of
  page 669 of [2].  It can be obtained via anonymous ftp from
  spade.pc.cs.cmu.edu in directory /usr/sleator/public.

  The chief modification here is that the splay operation works even if the
  item being splayed is not in the tree, and even if the tree root of the
  tree is NULL.  So the line:

                              t = splay(i, t);

  causes it to search for item with key i in the tree rooted at t.  If it's
  there, it is splayed to the root.  If it isn't there, then the node put
  at the root is the last one before NULL that would have been reached in a
  normal binary search for i.  (It's a neighbor of i in the tree.)  This
  allows many other operations to be easily implemented, as shown below.

calc_distnce() implemented by Jorge Murillo, 2017

This function takes a key and returns the numbers of keys that have a greater or equal value than that given. 
For SHARDS, the key is the Timestamp of the reference to a object in the trace (1 for the first object, 2 for the second, etc.) and the returned value
is the reuse distance of that reference.
For example: If we have a trace with the following objects

        a   b   c   a   d   d   b
                    ^
For the 5th object read in the trace ( the second instance of 'a'), we call calc_distance(5, dist_tree), and the returned value will be 3. Because the tree would look like: 

            c
           /
          b
         /
        a 

Meaning that there are at least three values equal or greater than a.
